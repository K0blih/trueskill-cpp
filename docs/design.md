# Implementation Decisions

## Compiled Library Instead Of Header-Only

The project is built as a compiled CMake library. This keeps compile times lower
for consumers and gives us a clean target that later CLI and HTTP binaries can
link against.

Header-only would be simpler for a tiny library, but the factor graph and math
implementation are large enough that hiding them in `.cpp` files is cleaner.

## Public API Separate From Internals

Public API lives in `include/skill_rating/skill_rating.hpp`. Internal implementation
lives in `src/detail/`.

This keeps users on stable concepts:

- ratings
- teams
- ranks
- weights
- environments

It avoids exposing implementation details like Gaussian precision math and
message passing.

## `include/skill_rating/` Folder

The nested include folder lets users write:

```cpp
#include <skill_rating/skill_rating.hpp>
```

This avoids collisions with other libraries that might also have a file named
`rating.hpp`, `environment.hpp`, or `skill_rating.hpp` once installed.

## Dependency-Light Core

The core rating library currently uses only the C++ standard library.

The CLI and HTTP service use `nlohmann/json` for JSON and `cpp-httplib` for the
HTTP server. They are kept outside the core `skill_rating` target so library users
do not inherit frontend dependencies unless they build those targets.

The install/export package only installs the core library target and public
headers. CLI and HTTP frontends are build targets, not part of the core package
contract.

## Factor Graph Style

The rating update follows the classic Bayesian skill rating factor-graph approach instead of
using only closed-form 1v1 formulas.

That choice matters because the library needs to support:

- teams
- more than two teams
- free-for-all matches
- draws
- partial-play weights

A factor graph handles those cases with one general update path.

## Plain Test Runner

The tests do not use a third-party framework yet. The custom runner is enough for
the current project size and keeps setup simple.

If test coverage grows substantially, moving to Catch2, doctest, or GoogleTest
would be reasonable.
