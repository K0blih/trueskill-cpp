# skill-rating-cpp
C++ implementation of a Bayesian skill rating algorithm

## Status

This repository currently provides the core C++20 library, a basic JSON CLI, and
a basic JSON HTTP service.

The HTTP service is intentionally basic. It is suitable for local development
and controlled internal use, but should not be exposed directly to the public
internet without TLS termination, authentication, request limits, logging, and
monitoring.

## Current capabilities

- Create ratings with standard Bayesian skill rating defaults or custom environment values.
- Update ratings for one-vs-one matches, team matches, free-for-all matches, and draws.
- Use explicit ranks where lower rank means a better result.
- Use partial-play weights for players who contributed less than a full match.
- Use zero weights for players who did not participate; they are returned unchanged.
- Compute match quality for one-vs-one and multi-team matches.
- Compute conservative exposure as `mu - 3 * sigma`.
- Convert between draw probability and draw margin.

## Planned additions

- Richer CLI ergonomics, examples, and shell-completion support.
- Richer HTTP service ergonomics, observability, and deployment examples.
- Serialization helpers for common request/response formats.

## Build And Test

The core library has no third-party runtime dependency. Building the CLI or HTTP
service fetches `nlohmann/json` and `cpp-httplib` with CMake `FetchContent`.

## Third-Party Dependencies

The core library target uses only the C++ standard library.

Optional frontend targets fetch these MIT-licensed dependencies at configure
time:

- `nlohmann/json`: https://github.com/nlohmann/json
- `cpp-httplib`: https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib

### Installable Package

Install the core library and CMake package files:

```sh
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake .. -DSKILL_RATING_BUILD_TESTS=OFF -DSKILL_RATING_BUILD_CLI=OFF -DSKILL_RATING_BUILD_HTTP=OFF
make -j
cmake --install . --prefix /path/to/install
```

Use it from another CMake project:

```cmake
find_package(skill_rating_cpp REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE skill_rating::skill_rating)
```

### Library

Build only the core library:

```sh
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake .. -DSKILL_RATING_BUILD_TESTS=OFF -DSKILL_RATING_BUILD_CLI=OFF -DSKILL_RATING_BUILD_HTTP=OFF
make -j
```

Build the library with tests:

```sh
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake .. -DSKILL_RATING_BUILD_TESTS=ON -DSKILL_RATING_BUILD_CLI=OFF -DSKILL_RATING_BUILD_HTTP=OFF
make -j
ctest --output-on-failure
./skill_rating_tests
```

### CLI

Build the CLI with the library and `nlohmann/json`:

```sh
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake .. -DSKILL_RATING_BUILD_CLI=ON
make -j
./skill_rating_cli --help
```

Run a direct CLI smoke check:

```sh
./skill_rating_cli quality '{"rating_groups":[[{"mu":25,"sigma":8.333333333333}],[{"mu":25,"sigma":8.333333333333}]]}'
```

When tests are enabled, CTest also runs `tests/cli_smoke.sh`, which covers all
CLI commands and an error path.

### HTTP Service

Build the HTTP service with the library, `nlohmann/json`, and `cpp-httplib`:

```sh
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake .. -DSKILL_RATING_BUILD_HTTP=ON
make -j
./skill_rating_http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080
```

In another shell:

```sh
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/health
curl -sS -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"rating_groups":[[{"mu":25,"sigma":8.333333333333}],[{"mu":25,"sigma":8.333333333333}]]}' \
  http://127.0.0.1:8080/quality
```

Run all enabled tests, including CLI and HTTP smoke tests:

```sh
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake .. -DSKILL_RATING_BUILD_TESTS=ON -DSKILL_RATING_BUILD_CLI=ON -DSKILL_RATING_BUILD_HTTP=ON
make -j
ctest --output-on-failure
```

The HTTP smoke test starts the service on loopback and checks every route plus
basic error responses.
